# Privacy Policy
Welcome to DataFire! Here on the left you'll find our plain-english privacy policy and the corresponding legal policy italicized below.

We last updated this policy December 23, 2015.

## Legal Privacy Policy
*Date of Last Revision: December 23, 2015
Welcome to the web site (the "Site") of DataFire, Inc. ( "DataFire", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by DataFire and has been created to provide information about our company and its content and data linking platform and related services (together with the Site, the "Service(s)") to our Service visitors ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth DataFire's policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.*

## Third-Party Service Integration
To use DataFire, we need to store credentials for third-party services (Gmail, Heroku, etc). We store credentials encrypted in our database. They are only used to access data you tell us to. We log certain non-identifiable information to provide support and fix problems.

*Our Service allows you to integrate and create commands for various online third-party services ("Third-Party Services"). In order to take advantage of this feature, you may need to authenticate, register for or log into Third-Party Services through the Service or on the websites of their respective providers. When you enable linking between or log in to Third-Party Services through the Service, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third-Party Service and your data and content contained within that Third-Party Service ("Login Credentials"). We store your Login Credentials long enough to enable linking to the Third-Party Service.

When you enable the Service to link content and data between Third-Party Services, the Third-Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that you may have provided to the Third-Party Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the rules you set to govern the linking. However, please remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such Third-Party Services, and DataFire shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third-Party Services that may be enabled within the Service.

We may retain certain personally non-identifiable information related to the data or content linked between Third-Party Services (for example, date sent, link configuration, names of the Third-Party Services), for the purpose of improving our Services and as described below in the "Non-Identifiable Data" section.*

## Third-Party Payment Processor
We use a third party payment processor, Stripe, for all payments. DataFire does not store credit card details and instead relies on Stripe for this.

*We use a third party payment processor to process payments made to us. In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personally identifiable information or any financial information such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to our third party processor, Stripe, whose use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy, which may be viewed at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.*

## Information We Collect

We ask for certain information like your name, email address, timezone, and account credentials to use DataFire. We use this information to run DataFire and other things mentioned in this Privacy policy (like logging and analytics).

For your convenience, we use cookies so you don't have to login every time you visit our website.

*When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the DataFire Services or use certain DataFire Services. Wherever DataFire collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.

By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of DataFire and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.

Cookies: In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service's features.Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the DataFire Services, DataFire often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and DataFire may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. DataFire may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

We will keep any information that you provide to us until such time as you delete your account with the DataFire Service.*

## Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information

DataFire won't sell or rent your personal information to a third party. Primarily, we use personal data to run DataFire. We may use personal data to provide you with predictions about other services you might be interested in on DataFire. If we intend to use your personal data in a way we have not mentioned, we will let you know when we collect that information.

Sometimes we aggregate user data anonymously to understand our customer base better.

*DataFire will not sell or rent to any third party any of the personal information or data that you provide to us. DataFire uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the DataFire Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. DataFire and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "DataFire Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the DataFire Services. DataFire and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

If DataFire intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.*

## Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information
We don't sell your personal data. If we work with partners or contractors, they may have limited access to your personal data but only so much to do their job.

If we sell the company, personal data may be included in the transfer.
